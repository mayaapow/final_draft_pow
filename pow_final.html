How much parental education influences their child’s measured intelligence is constantly being discussed. Especially since access to education and standardized testing study resources may correlate with income levels.

					<p> The discussion of how much parental education affects a child’s measured intelligence is constantly being discussed; especially when parental education connects with income levels which could influence a student’s access to standardized testing resources. The College Board consistently releases statistics and data on student performance on the Standardized Aptitude Test (a.k.a the SAT), a 1600 point test most college applications require. Research done on the last three years of data displays a correlation between the highest level of parental education and their child’s SAT score. </p>
					<p>College Board’s 2021 released data displays a trend where the higher a student’s parental level of education is, the higher their SAT score is, as shown in the bar chart below.</p>

					<p>Sophia Lyons, Chief Copywriter at The Appalachian, argues that tests like the SAT should be abolished in "<a href="https://theappalachianonline.com/opinion-abolish-standardized-college-admissions-testing/" target="_blank">OPINION: Abolish standardized college-admissions testing</a>", in a live interview.</p>
					<p>“Having less education doesn’t make as much money,” Lyons said. “With less money parents can’t afford prep courses and kids may get jobs rather than study.”</p>
					<p>The average SAT of this year is 1060, which is nine points higher than the average last year and one point higher than 2019’s average. These numbers are closer to average scores received by students with at least one parent with an associate degree; in the last three years, the average score was 1022.</p>
					<p>In the last three years, the mean score for students with at least one parent that graduated from high school (mean score of 983) was significantly higher than the mean score for students who do not have a parent that graduated from high school (mean score of 920), as shown in the bar chart to the left.</p>
					<p>The groups of students with at least one parent that has no high school diploma or only a high school diploma are progressively receiving lower mean SAT scores. The average score in 2021 is 949, in 2020 it was 950 and in 2019 it was 1915. Lyons says the score is decreasing because rising income inequality is becoming more prevalent in society.</p>

 			 “Yes, parents’ education status affects test scores, but the way to remedy this is by addressing systemic oppression in our society” - Sophia Lyons, Chief Copywriter at The Appalachian. 
			</div>
			<p>Lyons said she believes all college admission offices should terminate the requirement of standardized test scores. She claims that is the only way for there to be equity in college applications. </p>
			<p>“Beyond making test-prep resources free, accessible in schools and not limited to synchronous classes which would only work on one aspect of the problem, the only real solution is to abolish the test,” said Lyons. “There's no policy they can implement to change the fundamental premise of testing for one intelligence.” </p>
			<p>While some like Lyons believe standardized testing should not be required, some express the contrary view. Brandon McCoy, Project Manager of education policy at the Manhattan Institute, writes in his article, "<a href="https://www.city-journal.org/keep-the-sat-and-act">Keep the Tests</a>", that critics overstate how much wealth plays a factor in scores. </p>
			<p>“Standardized tests are one of the closest approximations we have to a uniform metric,” McCoy said. “Devaluing them or getting rid of them entirely will make college admissions more, not less, obscure.” </p>
			<p>Others like Mark Kantrowitz, Forbes Finance Writer, say while they think the test is important, it should be altered to accommodate different socioeconomic levels. His research study called “<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markkantrowitz/2021/05/21/how-admissions-tests-discriminate-against-low-income-and-minority-student-admissions-at-selective-colleges/?sh=582ff6223cc1">How Admissions Tests Discriminate Against College Admission of Minority and Low-Income Students at Selective Colleges</a>” argues that the issue is not internal discrimination, it’s rather the way the SAT is scored. Kantrowitz discusses a few plausible solutions to this discriminatory system.</p>
			<p>“College could stop using the SAT and ACT admission tests and an adjustment could be added to test scores of female, minority and low-income students,” said Kantrowitz. “The funding of public-school systems could be based on a statewide per capita basis instead of local taxes.”</p>
			<p>In the 2021-2022 admissions cycle, 75% of four-year colleges and universities are not requiring SAT or ACT (the American College Testing is another standardized test) scores on applications, according to <a href="https://www.ivywise.com/blog/colleges-going-test-optional/" target="_blank">IvyWise</a>. Some institutions like Barnard College, Gonzaga University and University of Colorado, Boulder are permanently moving to test-optional. </p>
